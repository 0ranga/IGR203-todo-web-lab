## About this lab

The goal was to create a simple to-do app that uses local storage to stay persistent across reloads. 
Other requirements included:
- ability to load tasks from a file on the server using the fetch() api
- prevent from putting two times the same to-do
- ability to remove all the completed tasks at once
