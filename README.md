## About this lab

The goal was to create a simple to-do app that uses local storage to stay persistent across reloads. 
Other requirements included:
- ability to load tasks from a file on the server using the `fetch()` api
- prevent from inputting an already-existing task
- ability to remove all the completed tasks at once
